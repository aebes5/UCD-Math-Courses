If you would like to read the full New York Times article either go to the [NYTimes website linked here](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/health/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-lecanemab.html) (that may be behind a pay wall) or [click here to download a pdf version of the full New York Times article](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=14ob9WwiAjeSoSDspuVVNnxen_ecURS-U) (not behind a pay wall).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<font size =\"2\">1. \"F.D.A Approves New Treatment for Early Alzheimer's\" by Pam Belluck, *New York times* published on January 6, 2023.</font>\n","\n","> The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new Alzheimer's drug that may modestly slow the pace of cognitive decline early in the disease, but also carries risks of swelling and bleeding in the brain.\n","\n","> The approval of the drug, lecanemab, to be marketed as Leqembi, is likely to generate considerable interest from patients and physicians. Studies of the drug --- an intravenous infusion administered every two weeks --- suggest it is more promising than the scant number of other treatments available. Still, several Alzheimer's experts said it was unclear from the medical evidence whether Leqembi could slow cognitive decline enough to be noticeable to patients.\n","\n","The New York Times article refers to a New England Journal of Medicine report of findings on an 18 month study on Leqembi. The report is a summary co-written by scientists from lead company making Leqembi.\n","\n","### <a name=\"back\">BACKGROUND</a>\n","\n","The accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated amyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) may initiate or potentiate pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A$\\beta$ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\n","\n","### <a name=\"methods\">METHODS</a>\n","\n","We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo.\n","\n","The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the\n","\n","-   Clinical Dementia Rating--Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment).\n","\n","Key secondary end points in a substudy were:\n","\n","-   the change in amyloid burden on PET,\n","-   the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment),\n","-   the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and\n","-   the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study--Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\n","\n","### <a name=\"results\">RESULTS</a>\n","\n","A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, $-0.45$; 95% confidence interval [CI], $-0.67$ to $-0.23$; $P < 0.001$).\n","\n","In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, $-59.1$ centiloids; 95% CI, $-62.6$ to $-55.6$). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, $-1.44$ (95% CI, $-2.27$ to $-0.61$; $P < 0.001$); for the ADCOMS, $-0.050$ (95% CI, $-0.074$ to $-0.027$; $P < 0.001$); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, $2.0$ (95% CI, $1.2$ to $2.8$; $P < 0.001$). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\n","\n","### <a name=\"conclude\">CONCLUSIONS</a>\n","\n","Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.
